Django Ex1
-----------

See django_notes.txt file for assistance on these exercises.  

1. Initialize your Django database. Add the seven NetworkDevice objects and two
   Credentials objects into your database.  After this initialization, you 
   should be able to do the following (from the ~/DJANGOX/djproject directory):

$ python manage.py shell

>>> from net_system.models import NetworkDevice, Credentials
>>> net_devices = NetworkDevice.objects.all()
>>> net_devices
[<NetworkDevice: pynet-rtr1>, 
 <NetworkDevice: pynet-sw1>, 
 <NetworkDevice: pynet-sw2>, 
 <NetworkDevice: pynet-sw3>, 
 <NetworkDevice: pynet-sw4>, 
 <NetworkDevice: juniper-srx>, 
 <NetworkDevice: pynet-rtr2>]

>>> creds = Credentials.objects.all()
>>> creds
[<Credentials: pyclass>, 
<Credentials: admin1>]


b. Update the NetworkDevice objects such that each NetworkDevice links to the 
   correct Credentials.
